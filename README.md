# Social-Network-API
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, I will use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that I will understand how to build and structure the API first.
My challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I will use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
